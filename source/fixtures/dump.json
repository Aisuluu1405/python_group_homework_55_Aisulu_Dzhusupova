    "text": "The EU's chief negotiator has said a Brexit deal could still be struck this week despite it becoming \"more difficult\" to reach an agreement.\r\n\r\nMichel Barnier said it was \"time to turn good intentions into legal text\". He has previously said \"big gaps\" remained between the UK and EU.\r\n\r\nHe will update EU ministers on Brexit talks at a meeting in Luxembourg later.\r\n\r\nDiscussions between EU and UK officials aimed at reaching a Brexit deal have intensified in recent days.\r\n\r\nHopes of a deal being agreed before the 31 October Brexit deadline were boosted after a meeting between Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart last week.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in Luxembourg on Tuesday morning, Mr Barnier said: \"An agreement will be more and more difficult but it is still possible this week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reaching an agreement is still possible but obviously any agreement must work for everyone - for all of the UK and the whole of the EU,\" he added. \"It is high time to turn good intentions into legal text.\"",

    "text": "After five major payments providers pulled out last week, Facebook\u2019s Libra currency project looked to be on the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut the remaining members have insisted it\u2019s full steam ahead.\r\n\r\nThe 21 founding companies in the Libra Association - down from 28 when the project was first announced - met for the first time in Geneva on Monday.\r\n\r\nA spokesman told the BBC he believed the currency was still on track to launch next year.\r\n\r\nBut, he added, it would only do so if suitable regulatory approval had been granted.\r\n\r\nIt comes after a stern warning from the G7 group of nations that Libra risked disrupting the global financial order.\r\n\r\nThat concern followed a letter to payments providers from US senators Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown, sent on 8 October, that threatened \u201ca high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities\u201d.\r\n\r\nLibra Association spokesman Dante Disparte criticised the senators, telling the BBC the letter \u201cstifles private market innovation\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt some level it confounds the regulatory process and the law-making process of free market economies,\u201d Mr Disparte said in a phone call on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe interference created a \u201cproblematic precedent for the state of private sector innovation\u201d, he added.",
